# Moja global project proposal template for GSoC

## GCBM Simulation Editor for FLINT-UI

### Abstract

Currently, there's an user interface to launch [The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT)](https://moja.global/flint/), called FLINT-UI. However, this interface lacks a way to modify the configuration parameters for the underneath model, [the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM)](https://community.moja.global/docs/GCBM/GCBM), which is capable to moderate the carbon flow of a given area. This project implements that missing interface for the user to visually configure the input parameters for the model, prior to run any simulation with the aforementioned model.

### Motivation

I want to contribute in a project related to environment management and climate change awareness, that is why I see the moja global project matching exactly with my interests and motivations. Personally, I've developed some user interfaces in the past for web applications and I think I'm skilled enough to help to fill the gap missing in FLINT-UI.

### Project plan

* Make an user story of an user intending to do a simulation with FLINT.(*)
* Study current workflow to create and run a simulation.
* Do some fixes of usability of current UI extracted from the previous studies.
* Design the layout for configuration of parameters window.
* Implement the above layout
* Implement widgets
* Create configuration from widgets and test the workflow.

(*): Potentially, It could be required to make many user stories for different personas or user cases.

### Past experience

In my first job, I was working as a full-stack developer of a webapplication fully in Javascript. I coded mostly in ReactJS, although I had to do a bit of nodeJS and mongo for the backend.
Later on I was working in the university as an asistant researcher. There I was downloading, processing and analyzing
big ammounts of data. I also developed [WikiChron](https://wikichron.science/), a web app to visualize metrics and
networks upon wiki communities from their historical data.
I have also done some small contributions to other open source projects from time to time (you can
see some of my contributions in my github profile).

### About me
I graduated in 2015 of my Bachelor's in Computer Science in the Universidad Complutense de
Madrid (UCM). During my time in the university, I founded a student association to support free &
open-source software called LibreLabUCM. I also did one academic year abroad in Cyprus underthe Erasmus program. After university, I was working for a bit doing tutoring, web development, IT
support and system administration.
From March 2017 to Spring 2019 I got a position as an assistant researcher in the university to
support the research around online collaborative communities, in particular wikis. During this time I
wrote some research papers doing data analysis regarding these communities and developed a visualization tool of the collaboration and productivity within a wiki using the community history.
In 2020 I finished my Master's in Data Science in an online university of Spain.
I heard about Google Summer of Code while I was studying in the university and I found it as a
very good opportunity to get started with real open-source projects, to develop computer skills (like
remote working, good coding practices) and get precious knowledge and experience.
This project gives me the opportunity to do something with real impact and useful for the society by
extension.
